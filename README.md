# Introduction  
This is a PyTorch implementation of [Neural Speed Reading via Skim-RNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02085.pdf) published on ICLR 2018.

The imdb dataset is used by default and stored in the */data* folder. 
Besides, the 300 dimensional GloVe word embedding trained under [840 billion words](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip)
is used.

# Usage
